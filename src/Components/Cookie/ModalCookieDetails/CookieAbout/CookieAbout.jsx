      <p>
        Cookies are small text files that websites store on your computer or
        device when you visit them. These files contain a small amount of data,
        such as information about your visit to the site, preferences, or
        authentication details.

      <p>
        The main purpose of cookies is to help websites remember specific
        information about you to provide a more personalized and convenient user
        experience. For example, when you log in to a site using your
        credentials, cookies allow you to remain authenticated throughout your
        session, so you don't have to enter your login and password every time.

        Cookies can be either temporary (session cookies), which are stored only
        for the duration of your visit to the site, or persistent, which are
        stored on your device for a longer period. However, cookies do not pose
        a threat to your security, as they are not programs and cannot execute
        code or transmit viruses.

      <p>
        It's essential to note that the storage of cookies may be limited by
        your browser settings, and you can choose whether you want to allow
        sites to store them on your device or prefer to delete them after each
        visit. Typically, users can manage cookie settings in their browsers to
        balance between convenience and privacy while browsing the internet.
